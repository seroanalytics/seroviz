Client-side React application for visualising serological data. Front-end for the [serovizr API](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr).

## Development

Install dependencies with `npm install`. Then the following scripts are available.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

For the app to work, the
[serovizr API](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr) must be running on port 8888; this can
be started using `scripts/run-dev-dependencies.sh`.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs unit tests using jest.

### `npm run itest`

Runs integration tests using jest. This requires the 
[serovizr API](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr) to be running; this can 
be started using `scripts/run-dev-dependencies.sh`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run generate-types`

Auto-generates typescript types based on the [serovizr](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr)
API JSON schema specifications. Generated types are saved into `src/generated.d.ts`.

## Deployment

### Docker
The app is deployed using a Dockerised `nginx` server.
See the [proxy/README.md](proxy/README.md) for details.

* To build the Docker image run `.scripts/build`. 
* To push an image to DockerHub run `./scripts/push`
* To start a copy of the Dockerised app locally run `./scripts/run`.

### Deploying the app
The Seroviz app is deployed on DigitalOcean's App Platform. You will need to be added to the seroanalytics team to make any changes to the settings. The Seroviz app has 2 services, 
each deployed using Docker images. One is the React application in this repo, and the other is the [serovizr API](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr).
The DigitalOcean app topology should look like this:

```yaml

- rule: DEPLOYMENT_FAILED
- rule: DOMAIN_FAILED

  type: PRIMARY

    repository: seroviz
    tag: main
  instance_count: 1
  instance_size_slug: apps-s-1vcpu-0.5gb
  name: seroviz
```

When changes to this repo are merged to main, the [deploy.yaml](https://github.com/seroanalytics/seroviz/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) Github Action will update the app spec with the latest Docker tag, which will trigger a deploy of the new version. Changes to `serovizr` are automatically deployed in a similar way.

## Domain 
The domain name `seroanalytics.org` is registered with NameCheap, but DNS is managed via DigitalOcean under the Networking section.
