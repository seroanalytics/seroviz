Client-side React application for visualising serological data.

## Development

Install dependencies with `npm install`. Then the following scripts are available.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

For the app to work, the
[serovizr API](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr) must be running on port 8888; this can
be started using `scripts/run-dev-dependencies.sh`.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs unit tests using jest.

### `npm run itest`

Runs integration tests using jest. This requires the 
[serovizr API](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr) to be running; this can 
be started using `scripts/run-dev-dependencies.sh`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run generate-types`

Auto-generates typescript types based on the [serovizr](https://github.com/seroanalytics/serovizr)
API JSON schema specifications. Generated types are saved into `src/generated.d.ts`.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using a Dockerised `nginx` server which also proxies the `serovizr` API.
See the [proxy/README.md](proxy/README.md) for details.

To build this Docker image run `.scripts/build`. To push an image to DockerHub
run `./scripts/push`. And to start a copy of the app locally with a self-signed SSL certificate
run `./scripts/run`.

### Setting up a new EC2 instance
(unless otherwise specified, all steps are run on the remote machine)

* Install the `hcp cli` for secret retrieval by following the [instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/cli/install)
* On your own machine, install the `hcp cli` if you haven't already, and retrieve the production service principal id and secret, stored at `production_id` and `production_secret`. If using the the cli, the commands are:
```shell
hcp vs secrets open production_id --app=seroviz
hcp vs secrets open production_secret --app=seroviz
```
* On the remote server, now login to `hcp` using these credentials:
```shell
hcp auth login --client-id=<client_id> --client_secret=<client_secret>
```
* Install `git`:
```shell
sudo yum -y install git
```
* Clone this Github repo using https:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/seroanalytics/seroviz.git
```
* Install Docker, following instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-docker.html)
* Run the `deploy` script in this repo:
```shell
cd seroviz
./scripts/deploy
```
